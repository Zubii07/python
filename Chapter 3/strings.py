# String is a data type in python.
# String is immutable data type in python ( means we can't change the value of string once it is assigned).
# String is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
# We can primarily use single or double quotes to define a string. e.g:



a = 'Hello'
b = "World"
c = '''Hello World'''



# String Slicing: A string in python can be sliced for getting a part of the string

name = "Zohaib"
nameshort = name[0:3]  # start from index 0 and end at index 3 (3 is not included)
print(nameshort)  # Output: Zoh
